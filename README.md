Mission Summary

For the first part, I made my player move better. I added jump and some running animations so it feels more like a real game. The player can move around, jump, and it looks nice when they run instead of just sliding around. This made it more fun to play and test stuff.For the second part, I made a short mission. The player goes to one cube, and a message pops up telling them to go to another cube. When you reach the second cube and press E, a fire starts to show that you finished the mission. I also made HUD text that changes so you know what to do next. The triggers only happen once and everything works fine.It’s a short mission but shows objectives, triggers, animations, and HUD text. You can move, jump, and finish the goal fast. It’s simple but complete enough to play from start to finish.


# Feature Check List
I made a spawn point that makes enemies appear one by one.

I made a wave manager that counts how many enemies are alive and when to start or stop spawning.

There are win and lose conditions — you win when all enemies are gone, and you lose when your health hits zero.

I added a HUD that shows my health and how many enemies are left.

There’s a health pickup that gives you health back when you touch it.

The arena has a few blocks and walls to make it more fun to run around.

I used two design ideas: enemies spawn in steady waves, and each wave gets a little harder.

# Directions
Use WASD to move and the Mouse to look around.

Use Left Click to shoot.

Run into the red cubes to take damage and test the health system.

Enemies will spawn automatically — try to survive until they’re all gone!

If your health hits zero, the player dies and the game is over.
